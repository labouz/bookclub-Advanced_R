# WHY???

---

## Translating R Code

- Consistency/Readability 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dbplyr)
translate_sql(x ^ 2)
#> <SQL> POWER(`x`, 2.0)
translate_sql(x < 5 & !is.na(x))
#> <SQL> `x` < 5.0 AND NOT(((`x`) IS NULL))
translate_sql(!first %in% c("John", "Roger", "Robert"))
#> <SQL> NOT(`first` IN ('John', 'Roger', 'Robert'))
translate_sql(select == 7)
#> <SQL> `select` = 7.0
```


- Efficiency

- Express problems & solutions in the same level of abstraction

???
dbplyr is the database backend for dplyr. It allows you to use remote database tables as if they are in-memory data frames by automatically converting dplyr code into SQL.

without these functions, you would have to switch languages in your script, with the help of other libraries, which may make it challenging for non-SQL collaborators to understand your code.

# DSLs

---
name: DSL

## **D**omain **S**pecific **L**anguages (DSLs)

.pull-left[

- What?

> A Domain Specific Language is a programming language with a higher level of abstraction optimized for a specific class of problems. A DSL uses the concepts and rules from the field or domain.

- How are they different from other programming languages?

  - less complex than a general-purpose language
  - developed in close coordination with the experts in the field for which the DSL is being designed. 

.footnote[https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/]
]

.pull-right[

### Advantages

- efficient

- avoid paying any runtime overhead

- thinking becomes clearer

- integration between the techies and the domain people

- independent of the target platform

- increased quality
]

???

In many cases, DSLs are intended to be used not by software people, but instead by non-programmers who are fluent in the domain the DSL addresses.

Once you've got the language and some form of transformation engine - DSL becomes much more efficient, simply because you don't have to do the grunt work manually

if you're generating source code from your DSL program (as opposed to interpreting it) you can use nice, domain-specific abstractions without paying any runtime overhead, because the generator, just like a compiler, can remove the abstractions and generate efficient code.

If you have a way of expressing domain concerns in a language that is closely aligned with the domain, your thinking becomes clearer because the code you write is not cluttered by implementation details

Using DSLs and an execution engine makes the application logic expressed in the DSL code independent of the target platform. Using DSLs can increase the quality of the created product: fewer bugs, better architectural conformance, increased maintainability.

# HTML

---
## Domain: HTML

### Basics  

.pull-left[

Basic structure of a page:

```html
<html>
<body>
  #body of your page
</body>
</html>
```
]

.pull-right[

Elements: these are your main "tags"  

- `<h1> Heading 1 </h1>`

- `<p> Wine is life.</p>`  

Attributes: provide additional information for the element, such as an image source (`src`) or a link's path (`href`). These are usually displayed as key/value pairs, i.e. `width="500"`. 
  
- *void* tags do not have any children/ content so their attributes are what is most important, i.e. `<img />` has `src`, `width` and `height`

]
---

## Example

![](img/inspect.png)
---

## Objective

### Make this:

```html

<body>
  <h1 id='first'>A heading</h1>
  <p>Some text &amp; <b>some bold text.</b></p>
  <img src='myimg.png' width='100' height='100' />
</body>

```

### With this:

```

with_html(
  body(
    h1("A heading", id = "first"),
    p("Some text &", b("some bold text.")),
    img(src = "myimg.png", width = 100, height = 100)
  )
)

```

???
this DSL is consistent with the domain. it follows the same nesting structure, named args become attributes and unnamed become the content of the tag, and certain cahracters like "&" are escaped.
---

## Let's do it `r emo::ji("muscle")` - Escaping

.pull-left[

**Problem**:  

`&`, `<`and `>` need to be automatically escaped while making sure they are not doubly escaped.

]
.pull-right[
**Solution**:

```{r}
# S3 classes for distinguishing HTML from text
html <- function(x) structure(x, class = "advr_html")

print.advr_html <- function(x, ...) {
  out <- paste0("<HTML> ", x)
  cat(paste(strwrap(out), collapse = "\n"), "\n", sep = "")
}

# funs for escaping text to html 
# and already escaped chars

escape <- function(x) UseMethod("escape")

escape.character <- function(x) {
  x <- gsub("&", "&amp;", x)
  x <- gsub("<", "&lt;", x)
  x <- gsub(">", "&gt;", x)

  html(x)
}

escape.advr_html <- function(x) x
```
]

???

because escaping is so fundamental to making this work, we will start with it

the way to get around these challenges is by creating an S3 class that distiguishes between regular text and html

There are two methods in the generic "escape" class - the character and the advr_html class. the first allows you to escape the characters and the second is for when you do not escape them. 
---
## Let's do it `r emo::ji("muscle")` - Basic Tags

.pull-left[

**Problem**:

- `<p>Some text &amp; <b>some bold text.</b></p>`

- Cannot put all the possible attributes of `<p>` because of volume and custom attributes

**Solution**:

`p("Some text. ", b(i("some bold italic text")), class = "mypara")`

1. Separate elements that are named and unnamed using `rlang::list2()`

  1. `rlang::list2()` : collects arguments via dynamic dots

1. Check to see if they are named or not

1. Return named/unnamed components separately

]
.pull-right[


```{r}
dots_partition <- function(...) {
  dots <- list2(...)
  
 if (is.null(names(dots))) {
  is_named <- rep(FALSE, length(dots))
} else {
  is_named <- names(dots) != ""
}
  
  list(
    named = dots[is_named],
    unnamed = dots[!is_named]
  )
}

str(dots_partition(a = 1, 2, b = 3, 4))
#> List of 2
#>  $ named  :List of 2
#>   ..$ a: num 1
#>   ..$ b: num 3
#>  $ unnamed:List of 2
#>   ..$ : num 2
#>   ..$ : num 4
```

]

???
what we going to do is create a function for one of the more basic tags and then generalise it for all HTML tags. 
p is one of the most common HTML tags. It has children like <i> and <b> 

so the first step is to create a function that partition anything that comes through the dynamic dots

---
## Let's do it `r emo::ji("muscle")` - Basic Tags pt.2

```{r}
source("dsl-html-attributes.r")
p <- function(...) {
  dots <- dots_partition(...)
  # grabs name/values pairs
  attribs <- html_attributes(dots$named)
  # check to see if there are children
  children <- map_chr(dots$unnamed, escape)

  html(paste0(
    "<p", attribs, ">",
    paste(children, collapse = ""),
    "</p>"
  ))
}

p("Some text")
#> <HTML> <p>Some text</p>
p("Some text", id = "myid")
#> <HTML> <p id='myid'>Some text</p>
p("Some text", class = "important", `data-value` = 10)
#> <HTML> <p class='important' data-value='10'>Some text</p>
```

???
now we create the <p> function. 

---
## Tag Functions

.pull-left[
**Problem**: generalise `p()` for other tags, like `<b>`

**Solution**:

1. Create a function with `rlang::new_function()`

1. Wrap the helper funcs within `expr({})`

  1. partition args  
  1. get attrs  
  1. get children  
  1. put it all together in nested `paste0`  
  
1. Return objects into the environment in which the fun was called otherwise the tags would be returned in the env in which the tag func was created
  
]
.pull-right[

```{r}
tag <- function(tag) {
  new_function(
    # not entirely sure what this line does
    exprs(... = ),
    expr({
      dots <- dots_partition(...)
      attribs <- html_attributes(dots$named)
      children <- map_chr(dots$unnamed, escape)

      html(paste0(
        !!paste0("<", tag), attribs, ">",
        paste(children, collapse = ""),
        !!paste0("</", tag, ">")
      ))
    }),
    caller_env()
  )
}

p <- tag("p")
b <- tag("b")
i <- tag("i")
p("Some text. ", b(i("some bold italic text")), class = "mypara")
#> <HTML> <p class='mypara'>Some text. <b><i>
#> some bold italic text</i></b></p>

```

]

???

now that we have created a tag for <p> we can generalise it

---
## Void Tags

Now we need a func to handle *void tags* like `<img>` - remember void tags have no children, they only have attributes so we need the function to produce an error if the `tag` argument is *unnamed*

```{r}
void_tag <- function(tag) {
  new_function(
    exprs(... = ),
    expr({
      dots <- dots_partition(...)
      if (length(dots$unnamed) > 0) {
        abort(!!paste0("<", tag, "> must not have unnamed arguments"))
      }
      attribs <- html_attributes(dots$named)

      html(paste0(!!paste0("<", tag), attribs, " />"))
    }),
    caller_env()
  )
}

img(src = "myimage.png", width = 100, height = 100)
#> <HTML> <img src='myimage.png' width='100' height='100' />
```

---

### ALL THE TAGS `r emo::ji("dance")`

```{r}
tags <- c("a", "abbr", "address", "article", "aside", "audio",
  "b","bdi", "bdo", "blockquote", "body", "button", "canvas",
  "caption","cite", "code", "colgroup", "data", "datalist",
  "dd", "del","details", "dfn", "div", "dl", "dt", "em",
  "eventsource","fieldset", "figcaption", "figure", "footer",
  "form", "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6", "head", "header",
  "hgroup", "html", "i","iframe", "ins", "kbd", "label",
  "legend", "li", "mark", "map","menu", "meter", "nav",
  "noscript", "object", "ol", "optgroup", "option", "output",
  "p", "pre", "progress", "q", "ruby", "rp","rt", "s", "samp",
  "script", "section", "select", "small", "span", "strong",
  "style", "sub", "summary", "sup", "table", "tbody", "td",
  "textarea", "tfoot", "th", "thead", "time", "title", "tr",
  "u", "ul", "var", "video"
)

void_tags <- c("area", "base", "br", "col", "command", "embed",
  "hr", "img", "input", "keygen", "link", "meta", "param",
  "source", "track", "wbr"
)
```

???

beware several of the tags clash with base r funcs so do not have them in the global environment or wrap them in a list
---
## Implementation

1. Named list containing all the tag functions:

```{r}
html_tags <- c(
  tags %>% set_names() %>% map(tag),
  void_tags %>% set_names() %>% map(void_tag)
)
# returns a large list of functions for each of the tags and void tags
```

2. Explicit utilization

```{r}
html_tags$p(
  "Some text. ",
  html_tags$b(html_tags$i("some bold italic text")),
  class = "mypara"
)
#> <HTML> <p class='mypara'>Some text. <b><i>some bold italic
#> text</i></b></p>
```

---
## The DSL! 

Finish with a function that puts it all together

```{r}
with_html <- function(code) {
  # environment in which you call the func
  code <- enquo(code)
  # transforms data into a data mask allowing quosures 
  # allows you to pass in the html_tags list as the data object to code quosure
  eval_tidy(code, html_tags)
}
```

Example:

```{r}
with_html(
  body(
    h1("A heading", id = "first"),
    p("Some text &", b("some bold text.")),
    # void tag
    img(src = "myimg.png", width = 100, height = 100)
  )
)
#> <HTML> <body><h1 id='first'>A heading</h1><p>Some text &amp;<b>some
#> bold text.</b></p><img src='myimg.png' width='100' height='100'
#> /></body>
```
